## Code of Conduct

We have adopted a code of conduct from the Contributor Covenant.  Contributors to this project are expected to adhere to this code.  Please report unwanted behavior to [jeff@jeffreyfritz.com](mailto:jeff@jeffreyfritz.com)

## What should I know before I get started?

This project is defining the coolest and simplest markup language delimited ONLY by tabs and carriage returns.  This started as a goof on YAML because @csharpfritz is not a fan of that markup technology, but grew into something that we believe may have a better purpose and functionality than YAML.

The purpose of this markup language is to delimit and format configuration files as well as formatting data for storage and transmission

### Project Folder Structure

This project is designed to be built and run primarily with Visual Studio 2019. The folders are configured so that they will support editing and working in other editors and on non-Windows operating systems.  We encourage you to develop with these other environments, because we would like to be able to support developers who use those tools as well.  The folders are configured as follows:

```
/docs                                  -- User Documentation
/src                                   -- TAML Parsers
  /dotnet
    /Taml.NET
      /Taml.NET                        -- DotNet Parser
      /Test.Taml.NET                   -- Unit tests
  /python
    /src
      /pytaml                          -- Python Parser
    /tests                             -- Unit tests

```

All official versions of the project are built and delivered with GitHub Actions and linked in the main README.md and [releases tab in GitHub](https://github.com/csharpfritz/TAML/releases).
