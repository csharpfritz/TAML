    "keywords": "JavaScript TAML Format Samples The following JavaScript configuration files are provided as a proposed definition of support to replace existing file formats with TAML alternatives. Package.json The defacto configuration file for JavaScript packages manages by the npm command-line utility is a simple format that could be replaced and made easier to read with the format and handling that TAML provides. Consider this sample package.json file: { \"name\": \"my_package\", \"description\": \"\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\" }, \"repository\": { \"type\": \"git\", \"url\": \"https://github.com/monatheoctocat/my_package.git\" }, \"keywords\": [], \"author\": \"\", \"license\": \"ISC\", \"bugs\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/monatheoctocat/my_package/issues\" }, \"homepage\": \"https://github.com/monatheoctocat/my_package\" } There's a lot in this file, and a lot of markup that confuses and makes the document locked to the JavaScript language for parsing and managing. When we convert it to TAML, it becomes simpler and clearer to understand the purpose of the configuration: name my_package description !\"\" version 1.0.0 scripts test echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1 repository type git url https://github.com/monatheoctocat/my_package.git keywords ![] author !\"\" licenses ISC bugs url https://github.com/monatheoctocat/my_package/issues homepage https://github.com/monatheoctocat/my_package"

Test Suite files reside in the /test_suite folder of the GitHub repository and are reproduced below with descriptions of how they should each be interpreted Naming Convention Compatibility levels are defined with teh first digit of the test suite file name, followed by an index number, a brief description, and the standard .taml file extension. 1_01_keyvaluepairs.taml ## Definitions - **Entries** in TAML are contiguous blocks of text that do NOT contain a tab (\\t) character. - **Keys** are an entry defined with one or more corresponding entries - **Values** are entries associated with a Key - **Complex Values** are entries comprised of a combination of Keys and Values - **Key Value Pairs** are a Complex Value made up of a Key and a Value - **Arrays** are a Complex Value comprised of a Key with multiple Values Compatibility Level 1 The initial release of the TAML specification is supported by these test suite definitions that provide the foundation of TAML interactions 1_01 - KeyValuePairs The first test ensures that the first two tenets of TAML are met and enforced: New entries are separated by carriage returns (CR / CRLF) Keys and values are separated by 1+ tab characters (\\t) There are 4 entries that should each be recognized as a key/value pair. New entries are presented on new lines and each key/value pair is separated by one or more tab (\\t) characters. key1 value1 key2 value2 key3 value3 key4 value4 1_02 - Arrays The second test ensure that tenet 4 is met: An array is a key with multiple child values Child values appear on a new line with one additional indent compared to the key value above it. Additional child values can be defined on proceeding lines at the same indentation level. This test should present 1 array defined by key containing 3 values. key value1 value2 value3 1_03 - Child Arrays The third test combines the first two features and tests for support of an array of three arrays each containing three values. value1 value12 value13 value14 value2 value22 value23 value24 value3 value32 value33 value34 1_04 - Child Key Value Pairs The fourth test combines the key value pair feature with the array feature to ensure support of a more complex structure that contains arrays of key value pairs with some values that are themselves arrays of more values and key value pairs. This sample should be parsed and return the following structure: A single array with a key named root Three values in the array: 2 key value pairs An array defined by key3 with 4 values: item1 , item2 , item3 item4 defines another array with 4 key value pairs as values root key1 value1 key2 value2 key3 item1 item2 item3 item4 key41 value41 key42 value42 key43 value43 key44 value44"
