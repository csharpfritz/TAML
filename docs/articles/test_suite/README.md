# The TAML Test Suite

To ensure compatibility between tools working with TAML files, we have provided a standard test suite of documents that help define the various levels of support.  Test Suite files reside in the `/test_suite` folder of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/csharpfritz/TAML) and are reproduced below with descriptions of how they should each be interpreted

## Naming Convention

Compatibility levels are defined with teh first digit of the test suite file name, followed by an index number, a brief description, and the standard `.taml` file extension.

```
1_01_keyvaluepairs.taml
```

## Compatibility Level 1

The initial release of the TAML specification is supported by these test suite definitions that provide the foundation of TAML interactions
